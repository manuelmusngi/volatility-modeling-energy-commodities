#### Volatility Modeling for Commodities and Equity Indices
This project is a production‑grade implementation of advanced volatility models inspired by Saltık, Değirmen, and Ural (2016). It implements the paper’s empirical framework into a modular Python application for forecasting, evaluating, and comparing conditional volatility across energy commodities and equity indices.

The system focuses on nonlinear dynamics, volatility clustering, asymmetry, and long‑memory effects—features that dominate real‑world financial return series but are often underrepresented in baseline models. Applications include risk forecasting, hedge ratio construction, and cross‑asset volatility analysis for markets such as WTI crude oil, Henry Hub natural gas, and the S&P 500 Index.

#### Key Capabilities
📈 Conditional Volatility Forecasting

Implements rolling out‑of‑sample forecasts using EGARCH and FIGARCH models to capture asymmetric responses to shocks and persistent volatility dynamics beyond standard GARCH assumptions.

📊 Model Evaluation via Loss Functions

Forecast accuracy is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), directly mirroring the loss‑function framework used in the reference paper to identify minimum‑loss models.

🔍 Cross‑Asset Volatility Structure Analysis

Applies identical model specifications across commodities and equities, enabling direct comparison of volatility persistence, asymmetry, and memory across asset classes.

🛡️ Risk Management & Hedging Applications

Forecasted conditional variances can be used to derive optimal hedge ratios, supporting practical decision‑making for traders, portfolio managers, and risk analysts.

#### Methodology: Mapping Code to Econometric Models
This section explicitly links each code module to the mathematical formulations presented in the paper.

#### 1. Return Process
     All assets are modeled as log‑returns:
                                   𝑟𝑡 = 𝜇 + 𝜀𝑡,  𝜀𝑡 = 𝜎𝑡𝑧𝑡,  𝑧𝑡 ∼ 𝐷(0,1)

#### Code mapping
- data/loader.py
  - Loads price data and computes log‑returns.

- config/settings.py
  - Defines distributional assumptions (GED, Student‑t).

#### 2. GARCH(1,1) — Baseline Model
                                   𝜎𝑡2 = 𝜔 + 𝛼𝜀2𝑡 − 1 + 𝛽𝜎2𝑡-1

#### Code mapping
- models/model_factory.py
  - Instantiates baseline GARCH specifications.

- models/forecasting.py
  - Fits model and generates conditional variance forecasts.

3. EGARCH(1,1) — Asymmetric Volatility

                         ln(𝜎2𝑡) = 𝜔 + 𝛼|𝜀𝑡 − 1/𝜎𝑡 - 1| + (𝛾) 𝜀𝑡 − 1/𝜎𝑡 − 1 + 𝛽ln(𝜎2𝑡 − 1)
                         
     Captures leverage effects and avoids non‑negativity constraints on variance.

#### Code mapping
- models/model_factory.py
  - EGARCH specification with asymmetric term.

- models/forecasting.py
 - Rolling estimation and volatility forecasting.
